      OpenWeatherMap API is called based on user input. User can choose to call
      for weather information in their current location or in a city of their
      choice. Once the user submits the call, OpenWeatherMap will return general
      weather information for the location the user submitted, and a main
      weather type (sunny, rainy, etc). The main weather type will determine the
      appropriate front-end background and also be fed into the Youtube API.
      Youtube API will take the main weather type as an argument and choose from
      pre-defined playlists related to the weather mood. This playlist will be
      pushed to the DOM as a list of 5 songs as buttons that can be clicked to
      launch an embedded Youtube player for that song.
