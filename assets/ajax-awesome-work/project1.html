            drivers find parking
            spaces or homeowners sell parking spaces in places of Urban areas. Users can search on the homepage for
            available parking spaces in a specific
            Zip
            Code or by their current location. They are then presented with a map showing markers of available spaces
            and the corresponding addresses to reserve a spot.</div>
        <div class="cbp-1-project-desc-text">ParkSmart uses a MySql database to store user and parking space data.
            Parking space data is displayed on the client side with the Google Maps API. Mocha/Chai was used for testing
            on this project as it was being developed.</div>
